<p>An example of the difference between the medical and the social model might be seen in the example of Gaynor, who is a wheelchair user and has been since she was involved in a car accident at the age of nine.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element internal-course-text">
<div class="wpb_wrapper">
<p>When Gaynor is at home, she is not disabled because she has full access to everything that she needs in order to live her life in a meaningful way. Her house has been adapted so that everything is available to her and she does not need to rely on anyone else in order to go about her daily activities.</p>
<p>However, when Gaynor needs to visit her local town to go shopping, she is seen as disabled. This is because the bus that she travels on does not always have space for her wheelchair, meaning that she either has to wait until one arrives, which does have space, or she has to take an expensive taxi ride instead.</p>
<p>When she is in town, there are some shops that she cannot get into because they do not have adequate ramp access and when she is in other shops, their floor merchandise is organised in a way that makes maneuvering her wheelchair almost impossible.</p>
<p>The social model has changed the way in which disabled people are viewed, it has certainly had an effect on some equality and anti-discriminatory legislation.</p>
<p>However, many people still revert to the medical model when they think of disabled people, and it is these attitudes that the social model is being developed in order to change.</p>
