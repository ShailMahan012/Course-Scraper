<p>Some of the risk factors that make children more susceptible to abuse include:</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element internal-course-text">
<div class="wpb_wrapper">
<ul class="fa-ul coursebullets">
<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-check-circle"><!-- icon --></i><strong>Disability:</strong> A child who is disabled is significantly more likely to experience abuse than a child who is not. This may be because they are less able to report what is happening to them and less able to defend themselves against physical and sexual abuse. Some signs of abuse are sometimes mistaken for symptoms of the disability and for this reason, may not be identified and acted on.<br/>
Children who have learning disabilities may not understand what is happening and may be easier to convince that what is happening is not wrong; some abusers are able to convince children that what they are doing is normal.</li>
<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-check-circle"><!-- icon --></i><strong>Isolation:</strong> children who are isolated, perhaps due to disability or mental health difficulties are more susceptible to abuse as they have less opportunity to report abuse. Being isolated means that a child is on their own more often and this increases the opportunities for an abuser to be alone with them.</li>
<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-check-circle"><!-- icon --></i><strong>Being in the care system (looked after children):</strong> A child who is in a local authority’s care system may already have been subject to abuse, making the possibility of this happening again more likely. Children who are looked after may have problems with confidence and self-esteem and may live with mental health difficulties that have been exacerbated by the reasons why they have been taken into care.</li>
<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-check-circle"><!-- icon --></i><strong>Has a parent who has substance or alcohol misuse issues:</strong> Not all parents who drink alcohol and/or take drugs will harm their children but children who live with parents who have substance misuse issues are at more risk of both abuse and neglect. This may be because the effects of substance misuse can leave parents unable to care for their children both on a practical and an emotional level, meaning that their needs are unmet.</li>
