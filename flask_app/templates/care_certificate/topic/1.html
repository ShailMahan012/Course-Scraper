<p>Those who work in health and social care should have the necessary skills, knowledge and behaviours to provide safe and high-quality compassionate care in their workplace. The Care Certificate is a vital part of training and development for those who are new to health and social care or new staff who already work in the sector. Some employers may also find it useful to assess existing staff against the Care Certificate standards.</p>
<p>The Care Certificate was introduced in April 2015 in response to the findings of the Cavendish Review, which was published in July 2013. The Cavendish Review found that training and development in health and social care were inconsistent and inadequate. Health Education England, Skills for Care and Skills for Health jointly developed the Care Certificate to improve the quality of training.</p>
<p>The Care Quality Commission (CQC) expects health and social care providers to induct, support and train their staff appropriately. By using the Care Certificate as part of their induction programme, employers can demonstrate to the CQC that they are meeting these criteria.</p>
