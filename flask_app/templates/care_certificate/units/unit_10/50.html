<p>One afternoon at the session, Louise is stopped by Kim who has a distressed expression. Louise asks her what is wrong and Kim tells her that she has been attacked again by her neighbour who waits until she is alone in the house before entering using the key that Kim’s parents gave him last year when he looked after their home whilst they were on holiday.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element internal-course-text">
<div class="wpb_wrapper">
<p>Louise tells Kim to tell her again about what has happened because all of the details came out in a rush.</p>
<p>Kim starts to repeat them but Louise stops her, as she is of the opinion that Kim is blurring fantasy with reality and that it is highly unlikely that what she is saying is the truth, as she knows the neighbour Kim is referring to and he is a highly respected businessman who would never do such a thing.</p>
<p>She tells Kim not to be silly and that it is just a symptom of her illness that didn’t really happen and that saying such things can get people into trouble.</p>
<p>In this instance, Louise’s bad practice in response to Kim’s disclosure could put Kim at risk of repeated abuse.</p>
<p>Even if Kim is not telling the truth because she cannot separate reality from fantasy, Louise still has a duty of care to report the information to her manager so that a decision can be made about how to proceed.</p>
<p>Louise’s reaction may also mean that if Kim is genuinely abused in the future or is at any sort of risk, that she will not feel able to report it as no one will believe her, which again, puts her at risk.</p>
